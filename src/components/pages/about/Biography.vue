          My name is Nathan Spinetti, and I am enrolled in the Grad Certificate
          in Web Application Development. I do hope one day to enroll in the
          Master's program, but not just yet. This is my 2nd course, I started
          with Data Structures and Algorithms in Java. I enrolled in this
          program in hopes to further my knowledge in frameworks and backend
          work, so I am very excited to get started in these core classes.

          <h3>Professional Development</h3>
          <p>
            I have a bachelors in Graphic Design with a focus in Web Design, and
            have worked for the past 2 years as a Designer/Developer. I just
            started a new job in May as a
            <a href="https://www.workhuman.com/" target="_blank"
              >Jr. Web Developer</a
            >
            and am ready to dive into the technical side of things with the hope
            of becoming a Full Stack Developer one day. With this course
            specifically I am aiming to get a better grasp of Javascript and
            start off in Vue.<br /><br />I have been primarily working on
            <a href="https://www.workhumanlive.com/"
              >Workhuman<sup>Â®</sup> Live.</a
            >
            On WHL, I have been developing the upcoming Europe event. I also
            have a big project called Workhuman Spotlight on the main
            <a href="https://www.workhuman.com/">Workhuman</a> website coming
            up.

        <h3>Family and Interests</h3>
        <p>
          I live in Massachusetts with my family, 3 dogs, and my cat. My dogs
          names are Baxter, Bentley, and we have a 15 week old puppy Oliver. And
          my cats name is Felix. When I am not working or studying, I am either
          travelling or hanging in at home. In the past few years I have gone to
          Italy, done a road trip from Chicago to Rhode Island, and a road trip
          from Chicago to Florida. I also just recently went to Florida where we
          hung out at the beach and went to Disney! When I am hanging in at home
          I like to play games with friends and spend time with my pets and
          family.
