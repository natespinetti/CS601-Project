CS601 Term Project

The goal of this project was to create a portfolio for myself utilizing Vue and everything that was taught throughout this course. I went through each and every assignment and took the best chunks of each to get a good foundation for this project. I took inspiration from my current website as well as my company's in many different ways. I wanted to create something that I could keep adding to and making better, so I know this is not the end of the road, I'll keep adding a piece of me into each and every page along the way.

Here's an outline of my website:
